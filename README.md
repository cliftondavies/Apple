## Project Implementation

### Content & Structure

The webpage is divided into three parts (Top, Middle and Bottom), which are then enclosed within a Page Wrapper.

The Top consists of a nav bar created with a list of links, two icons and an input. This part also contains a header, with images used to present a heading and some introductory text.

Similar to the nav bar within the Top, the Middle is built with a list of fours links used to display four linked images.

Finally, the Bottom/Footer contains small prints, structured with a couple of paragraphs, and a list of footer links.

### Layout & Presentation

CSS Grid is solely employed for the layout and alignment of this webpage.

For the Page Wrapper, a grid with three rows is created to position the three main areas - Top, Middle and Bottom/Footer.

A background image is applied to the Top. This part is laid out as a two-row grid to position and align the nav bar and header within it. The nav bar is mainly styled using an eight-column grid and a linear-gradient background. The list items and their links are displayed as grid in order to center the text content within them. A background image is also applied to the input field within the nav bar, and a border is set on it, so that its height can be adjusted. The search icon is positioned as absolute within the input field.

The list of images in the Middle are laid out using a grid which automatically fits as many images based on the grid column sizes specified.

The Bottom/Footer is justified center. Thereafter, it is also defined as an auto-fit grid to layout the small prints and links it contains. Lastly, a grid with eight columns is used to horizontally display the footer links.
